# Snap-vote application

Snap-vote app made with ReactJS. An App created to help the decision-making process. You can instert the number of voters, the topic you're voting on and add pros and cons to each of them.  In the end each user can vote and the result will be displayed in decrescending order.
Made using React hooks (useState, useEffect, useContext) and React context.
